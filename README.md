# Restaurant-Recommendation-Chatbot
Introducing my creation: a restaurant chatbot. Input preferences like location, cuisine, budget; receive personalized suggestions with ratings. Smart NLP and a recommendation system make it happen. User-friendly interface, rigorously tested for efficiency.

The project involves creating a chatbot that assists users in finding suitable restaurants based on their preferences. The chatbot will take as input sentences from user and find keywords thay hint at location, cuisine preferences, and budget constraints, and then provide recommendations for restaurants that match these preferences. It will offer feature to limit the number of matches user wishes to receive. The chatbot will display restaurant details such as names, addresses, contact information, and user ratings. To build the chatbot, the following steps were followed:

Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collect restaurant data from reliable sources and structure it.
- Clean and normalize the data, removing duplicates and standardizing addresses.

Step 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Develop a module for understanding user queries.
- Extract key information like location, cuisine preferences, and budget using techniques like named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.

Step 3: Recommendation System
- Create a recommendation system using user preferences to fetch relevant restaurants.
- Utilize content-based or collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions.

Step 4: User Interface and Interaction
- Design a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.
- Implement a conversational flow that guides users through the interaction and seeks clarification when needed.

Step 5: Evaluation and Iteration
- Test the chatbot with a range of user queries and assess its performance.

Overall, the goal was to build an efficient and user-friendly chatbot that can help users discover restaurants tailored to their preferences. The project involves data collection, NLP implementation, recommendation system development, user interface design, and iterative testing to enhance the chatbot's performance.
